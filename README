This is a minimal wrapper around SQLite. 

It is derived from Dylan Bruzenak's SQLite chapter 
in "iPhone Advanced Projects" (Apress).

It includes the source for SQLite so that we can enable 
and test some optional SQLite features. Currently the
RTREE and FTS3 (full text search) indexes are enabled.
See the Nukefile for the necessary build settings for this.
